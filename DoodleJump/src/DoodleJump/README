HANDIN: (on time)

DESIGN CHOICES:

This DoodleJump has 6 classes.

App is in charge of running the application.

PaneOrganizer is the top-level object that contains the multiple panes of the 
project and their children. The label changing based on whether Doodle has
fallen beneath the pane and the quit button are contained here since they are 
not part of the animation pane. BorderPane was chosen as the root node since it 
can set different nodes to different positions. VBox was chosen as the type pane 
for the menu pane for its vertical alignment.

Game is the animation pane in charge of animating the application and handling
key inputs. It is associated with PaneOrganizer in order to be set in the center
of the BorderPane and to later call BorderPane's method to update the label upon
the Doodle falling beneath the pane. The TimeLine in charge of the Doodle's 
physics, the generation and scrolling of Platforms, and ending the
game is contained here. The Doodle, the KeyHandler responsible for moving the 
Doodle, and the first platform hard-coded beneath the Doodle are contained here. 
An ArrayList has been chosen as the data structure to store generated Platforms 
because the number of Platforms contained in this list is constantly expanding 
and contracting. Platforms are being added to the ArrayList and graphically 
added from the top of the pane and then removed from the ArrayList and 
graphically removed upon passing the bottom of the pane.

Doodle contains the rectangle shape to be added to the animation pane and
relevant methods for animation.

Platform contains the template, rectangle shape to be added to the animation 
pane and relevant methods for animation.

Constants contains constant values to clean up code throughout the other
classes.

KNOWN BUGS: None.
